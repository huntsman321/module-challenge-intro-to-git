## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? A set of commands we can use in the terminal to modify files.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Github is where we store all of the code. Git is what we use to manage the code via the terminal. 
3. Why do we create a branch? Allows us to modify the original code in a separate save.  These separate saves act as a backup of all previous versions of the code.  After the branch is complete and has been tested, it can be pushed back into the main code. 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? A pull request allows us to compare the changes made.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. cd filename
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch: used to tell local repository that there are changes from remote repository without bringing changes into local repository   git merge: merges separate git branches into one branch.  git pull: used to bring a copy of the remote directory changes into local repository 
7. What is a merge conflict? This occurs when Git is unable to resolve differences in code between two commits automatically. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Ensure that commits are on different branches/lines
